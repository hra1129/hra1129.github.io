## Description

This project is a port of the [1chipMSX](http://www.msx.d4e.co.jp/1chipmsx.html) to [DEOCM](http://yone2.net/deocm) + [DE0-CV](https://www.terasic.com.tw/cgi-bin/page/archive.pl?Language=English&No=921)
including modification of [OCM-PLD](https://gnogni.altervista.org/).

## How to install

1. [Register and SignIn for Intel FPGA Program.](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/forms/fpga/fpga-individual-registration.html)
2. [Download and install 'Additional Software>Quartus Prime Programmer and Tools'.](http://fpgasoftware.intel.com/?edition=lite&platform=windows&download_manager=direct)
3. [Download and unzip pof file from deocm-pld-cv Releases.](https://github.com/uniabis/deocmpldcv/releases)
4. Connect your PC and DE0-CV with USB cable.
5. Set the RUN/PROG slide switch (SW10) of DE0-CV to the PROG position.
6. Run 'Quartus Prime Programmer and Tools' and write pof file to flash memory(EPCS) on DE0-CV.
7. Set the RUN/PROG slide switch (SW10) of DE0-CV to the RUN position.
